Talking of inviting me back to PDP is wrong and it is a great misrepresentation as I have never left PDP and I will never leave PDP.</i></p><p><i>"I have said it before and I will say it again, I rose to become the President of Nigeria on the platform of PDP and for that reason alone, I will remain a card-carrying and ward-active member of PDP for as long as I have to be a political party member.</i></p><p><i>“Secondly, nobody has personally offended me as a result of my membership of PDP. If, however, anybody or group feels offended by my continued membership, I will offer an unreserved apology but continue to remain in the Party.</i></p><p><strong>READ ALSO</strong>: <a href=#>CRISIS: PDP Chairman, Governors In Cold War</a></p><p><i>"I have had occasions to say to the President, the Senate president and the Party chairman separately that I have no quarrel with any individual or group in the Party. There are, for me, issues of principle, morality, honour, integrity, commitment and character which are paramount.</i></p><p><i>“For instance, as a former President of Nigeria, the chairman of West Africa Commission on Drug and a member of Global Commission on Drug, I cannot accept that the zonal leader of my political party and, worse still in my zone, will be an indicted drug baron wanted in America.</i></p><p><i>"How do I explain that to friends outside Nigeria? This is only one of the many issues that I have pointed and still pointing out. I have national and international standard to maintain and reputation to keep and sustain. For these reasons, I opted to remain active only at the ward level of the Party till the leadership does the needful. But under no condition will my commitment to Nigeria be diminished.</i></p><p><i>“And, for me, it is commitment to Nigeria first and any other commitment can only follow in second or third place. Where any other commitment is in tandem with what I see and understand as commitment to Nigeria, such other commitment will share a pride of place with Nigeria.</i></p><p><i>"I must hasten to thank the President, the Senate president and the Chairman of PDP with whom, at their instances, these issues have been discussed and laid to rest. My interest and commitment to Nigeria go beyond partisan politics.</i></p><p><i>“Today, Nigeria needs all hands on deck to deal with our pressing problems of security including the issue of Chibok girls, widening inequality, infrastructure, impunity, corruption, poverty and youth education, skill-acquisition, empowerment and employment. These are issues of concern to most Nigerians. We all need to join hands to move Nigeria forward. I don’t need to be begged for that.</i></p><p><i>“Rather, I beg and appeal to those who are begging me to realize that we must put Nigeria’s interest above politics – party or personal – otherwise, we will all be judged at the bar of history if not the bar of current affairs.&nbsp; In addition, we must preserve, sustain and deepen democracy and democratic practices.”</i></p><p>On October 8, it was reported that the <a href=#>leadership of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) went to beg the former President of Nigeria, Olusegun Obasanjo, in Abuja for forgiveness and asked him to come back to the party</a>.</p><p>The PDP leaders included the National Chairman of the ruling party&nbsp;Alhaji Adamu Muazu, Senate President David Mark and former governor of Ogun State&nbsp;Otunba Gbenga Daniel.</p><p><i>“All of us must beg Obasanjo to forgive us. We need to beg him. He is very prayerful and we need to ask him to forgive us so that we can be forgiven. We are your children.&nbsp;We have made mistakes and baba, please forgive us. Come and lead us. We are your followers and we assure you that we are all good boys and girls. We have sinned. Baba please forgive us.”</i></p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkgHGAk2xuZq%2BYrnqqecCmZKenpGKupMDIr5xmoZ5ivaW8jKiZmquRo7ewec6pnKerXaq9b7TTpqM%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./apc-pdp-refuse-to-disclose-campaign-funding-sources-obi-reveals.html>&#171;&nbsp;APC, PDP Refuse To Disclose Campaign Funding Sources, Obi Reveals</a>
