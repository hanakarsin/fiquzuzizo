Scooter has reportedly done anything imaginable to retain his clout in Hollywood.</p><p>"People with the most severe addiction problem will never understand just how absurdly powerful an addiction to fame and power is," a previous business associate of Scooter's said. "It's the single most wicked, evil, and disastrous addiction you can think of. You can do whatever you want, whenever you want. And that sort of power, once you have it, is the closest thing to impossible to give up."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecisZJ6ulafGsLrEZqOemaaeu6h50pymqKyVp3qjvsCupQ%3D%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./ban-zoe-from-tiktok.html>&#171;&nbsp;Ban Zoe From TikTok?
