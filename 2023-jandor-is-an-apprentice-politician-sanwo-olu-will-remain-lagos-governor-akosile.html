Sanwo-Olu Will Remain Lagos Governor</h1><div id=sub-header>August 2024 · 4 minute read</div><div class=entry-content><img

Democratic Party (PDP) governorship candidate for Lagos State, Olajide Adediran, aka <a href=# rel=noopener>Jandor</a> has been described as an “apprentice candidate and politician.”</h2><p>The description was made by the Chief Press Secretary to the Lagos State Governor, <strong>Gboyega Akosile</strong> who added that Jandor is still in the training school of politics and may graduate after the 2023 elections but if he has not learnt his lesson, then would continue in school.</p><p>Akosile added that it is an insult to the people of Lagos for Jandor to say he would defeat <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Governor Babajde Sanwo-Olu</a></strong> who is the candidte of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the 2023 elections.</p><p>Sanwo-Olu’s media aide further described any idea about winning the 2023 governorship election in Lagos State by Jandor and the PDP as wishful thinking.</p><p><strong>Naija News</strong> reports the CPS stated this while reacting to the submission by Adediran (Jandor) that he would <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>defeat Sanwo-Olu and his godfathers</a></strong> in the forthcoming elections.</p><p>Jandor stated this on October 2022, while appearing on Arise TV’s The Morning Show.</p><p>His statement comes after Rivers State Governor, <strong>Nyesom Wike</strong> endorsed Sanwo-Olu for another term in office and urged other candidates <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>not to waste their time</a></strong> by contesting against the incumbent Governor.</p><p>Akosile in a chat with The Punch dismissed any challenge that Jandor may want to put up in the 2023 polls.</p><p>In his words, “Simply put, it (Jandor’s comment) is wishful thinking as far as I am concerned and that statement is an insult on Lagos electorates. Don’t forget he is a politician, but an apprentice candidate and politician.</p><p>“He will understand the game and learn better after the 2023 elections. He (Jandor) is in (political) training school and I wouldn’t want to join issues with him because I understand he is still learning the ropes.</p><p>“He is an apprentice candidate and when he is mature we can talk extensively about his chances of defeating Sanwo-Olu. But I believe he will learn during next year’s elections and graduate and if not, he will have to wait till the next election cycle in 2027.”</p><h2>Sanwo-Olu And His Team Will Be Shocked</h2><p>Responding to the position by Akosile, the media aide to Adediran, <strong>Mr.&nbsp;Gbenga Ogunleye</strong>, on Wednesday said it is left to the people of Lagos to choose their leader.</p><p>He warned against any form of boasting saying the real apprentice will be revealed at the polls come 2023.</p><p>The media aide added that Sanw-Olu can not boast of any project initiated and completed by his administration but has been plunging the state into more debt with huge borrowings.</p><p>Ogunleye added that he is not surprised by what Akosile said because he is simply doing what he is being paid to do.</p><p>He said, “It (apprentice candidate) is from his (Akosile) imagination. Don’t forget he (Akosile) is also just trying to justify his pay. I do not know what he exactly meant by apprentice candidate because everyone will have a first time contesting to be a governor.</p><p>“What has Mr. Sanwo-Olu done in three years that justifies his reelection? he has failed abysmally. He has not started a project as a governor and completed that project within the last three years and whatever you see him doing has to be a project initiated by either former governors Ambode or Babatunde Raji Fashola and that is how bad his administration has been.</p><p>“No project initiated and completed in the last three years and yet he is claiming he has an IGR of over N50 billion and yet in the last three years, he has borrowed over N100 billion, what have you done with these humongous resources?</p><p>“The days of Sanwo-Olu’s government are numbered and the people of Lagos will reject them at the poll and vote them out. Akosile should be looking for another job because he is not going to retain his job in 2023 and that we are sure of.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5xe5FwZmtoYmh6q63NnaarZZmoeqK6jJqnqaqVo8Gqr8Rmp6ikmam2pLXAp2SsmZ6svG67y65ksKGcoXqzscyaoKdlnJa0sL%2BMoKavnaKjvLN5wKSmrKGcmnw%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./rochelle-clark-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;Rochelle Clarke - Age, Family, Bio</a>
