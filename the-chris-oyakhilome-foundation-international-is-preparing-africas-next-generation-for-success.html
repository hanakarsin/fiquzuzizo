International Is Preparing Africa's Next Generation For Success</h1><div id=sub-header>August 2024 · 5 minute read</div><div class=entry-content><p><i><span>Through its own initiatives and its support of distinguished humanitarian agencies, the Chris Oyakhilome Foundation International is lifting up the next generation of Africa’s children out of impoverished conditions and giving them the tools they need to be successful, Spirit-filled leaders in their communities.</span></i></p><p><span>The </span><a href=# rel=nofollow><span>Chris Oyakhilome Foundation International (COFI)</span></a><span> is a Christian based non-governmental organization that has dedicated itself to improving the lives of children across Nigeria, the continent of Africa and beyond. The organization was established to help the most vulnerable people by providing them with unique opportunities and educational, physical and spiritual support to achieve their God-given potential. COFI was founded and is led by Pastor Chris Oyakhilome, the passionate and charismatic leader of </span><a href=# rel=nofollow><span>Christ Embassy</span></a><span>. His generous leadership has allowed the foundation to flourish in its efforts to aid those most in need – underprivileged youth.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><b>Children hold the Future</b></h2><p><span>The foundation has identified four key areas to dedicate its efforts as to promote the greatest good for those most in need: healthcare, early childhood education and development, youth leadership development and engagement, and family strengthening and livelihood. Each of these focal points aims at creating stronger communities and nurturing individuals to affect positive change in the world.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>COFI believes that the solution to society’s problems can be found in the Word of God and that the next generation has the potential to create a better world for all of us. COFI is dedicated to providing children with the tools and sustenance they need to be great leaders and motivators of change. Through its initiatives and partner agencies, the foundation also believes it is vital to identify, support and celebrate young individuals who are making a difference.</span></p><h2><b>COFI sponsors the InnerCity Mission&nbsp;</b></h2><p><span>The Chris Oyakhilome Foundation International sponsors the work of the </span><a href=# rel=nofollow><span>InnerCity Mission for Children</span></a><span>, a non-profit organization operating around the world through diverse programs that aim at ending child poverty and providing children with quality healthcare, nutrition and education. The organization focuses its efforts on breaking the cycle of poverty by helping provide for indignant children living within inner cities. The goal of the InnerCity Mission is to give every life meaning and hope for a better future.</span></p><p><span>The InnerCity Mission operates health and nutrition programs that seek to improve the quality of life, as well as life expectancy for those children who live in impoverished conditions. Poor nutrition and starvation can affect a child’s physical, mental and social well-being. Children who do not get proper nutrition struggle to concentrate on their studies and are unable to thrive in school. The organization provides school health programs and maintains food banks to collect food for those most in need.</span></p><p><span>Providing quality educational opportunities is a pillar of the Chris Oyakhilome Foundation International. The early years of a child’s life have an enormous impact on who they will become as adults. Early educational and developmental support is vital in fostering successful individuals who can positively impact their communities. The InnerCity Mission operates nursery and primary schools, child mentoring programs and extra-curricular initiatives to promote well-rounded child development.</span></p><p><span>COFI believes that a strong family forms the foundation of a strong community. For this reason, the organization works to provide support and development programs to help strengthen families so that they can better fulfil<img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Chris-Oyakhilome-foundation-2.png alt width=1500 height=1125 sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto> the needs of their children. COFI supports the InnerCity Mission’s efforts to provide welfare assistance, mentoring support and programs designed to empower families living in less than desirable conditions.</span></p><h2><b>Celebrating Young Leaders</b></h2><p><span>The Chris Oyakhilome Foundation International is dedicated to delivering sustainable interventions that not only satisfy the basic needs of children but empowers them to become a force for positive change in their communities, their countries and in the world. COFI sponsors the </span><a href=# rel=nofollow><span>Future Africa Leaders Foundation (FALF)</span></a><span> to celebrate and encourage those who have demonstrated exemplary leadership skills and have found inventive and innovative ways to help others.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>FALF seeks to impact the next generation of Africa’s leaders through education, youth empowerment and mentoring projects. The organization nurtures and strengthens young men and women so that they can lead their communities into the future. The organization identifies and celebrates youth making a difference with the </span><span>Future Africa Leaders Awards (FALA)</span><span> which are held annually.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Talented youth are nominated from nations across the African continent for these globally recognized awards. Each nominee is awarded $10,000 and one outstanding nominee is chosen as a Star Award Winner and receives a prize of $25,000. The prize money serves as a token of encouragement for the young nominees to continue their extraordinary endeavours<img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Chris-Oyakhilome-foundation-3.png alt width=1375 height=1031 sizes="(max-width: 1375px) 100vw, 1375px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto>. All prize funds are provided by Pastor Chris Oyakhilome, the creator and top motivator of the awards program.</span></p><p><span>The 2018 FALA Star Award Winner was Isaiah Deng of South Sudan. Deng took impressive action to empower youth within his country, torn apart by civil war and suffering an unimaginable humanitarian crisis. He organized and led several youth development conferences, training programs, leadership forums and training sessions aimed at creating engaged and socially active young people. Deng also motivated young people to be charitable by giving to those in need and then coordinated the donation of food and personal hygiene products delivered to internally displaced people and poor families across South Sudan. He also spearheaded efforts to improve the lives of displaced people living within refugee camps.</span></p><h2><b>Children are a Heritage from the Lord</b></h2><p><span>COFI takes great pride in knowing that its altruistic efforts produce a positive and enduring impact on their lives of children, their families and the communities in which they reside. The foundation invests in youth through programs that provide a child’s essential needs, support academic achievement and create a foundation for lifelong learning and success. Children who are given access to early educational opportunities and are encouraged for their accomplishments become happy, fulfilled adults. It is the ultimate goal of the Chris Oyakhilome Foundation International to help vulnerable and indignant children achieve their full potential by supporting their educational, spiritual and social needs.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>To learn more about the Chris Oyakhilome Foundation International and to support their current and future initiatives to nurture and empower youth please </span><a href=# rel=nofollow><span>click here</span></a><span> to visit their website.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWlpZH13e5FvZq2glWKwqb7IrGSosZGgtaq4zqacZp6fqrulrdOipqdlmaPBpr7Nmquip56WuW610manq52glr%2BqusZmmJ%2BqmZiutHnNnq%2BtZZeau6a%2BwK2gqKZdm7yzedKumpydo6h8</p></div><div id=links><a href=./jencarlos-canela-expanding-world-of-ashley-garcia.html>&#171;&nbsp;Who is Jencarlos Canela from The Expanding World of Ashley Garcia, Anyway?</a>
