He has been consistently among the <a href=#>best-selling rappers</a> in the United States since the late 1980s to even today. By 2017, Ice Cube had sold over <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">10 million albums</a>, between 14 solo and group albums. Here is a breakdown of Ice Cube’s earnings over the years according to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">TheRichest</a> and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">RIAA</a>:</p><h3>Early Beginnings – 1986-1989</h3><p class=align-left>Ice Cube kicked off his music career in the mid-80s when he joined the hip-hop group called CIA. The group released a single in 1987 titled <i>My Posse</i>. Although they performed together for some time, he left and became a founding member of NWA together with Easy E and Dr Dre.</p><p class=align-left>In 1988, the NWA released a debut album called <i>Straight Outta Compton</i>. It was a hit that sold over 3.5 million copies. The group then released a second album titled <i>Niggaz4Life</i> in 1991, which sold over 2.3 million copies within the USA. But his stay with the NWA was short. He parted ways after earning less than $100,000. Ice Cube decided to launch his solo career.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/8f6ff6b20ea21631.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Nicky Jam's net worth in 2021: annual income, house, record deal, sales</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/edd6d8616df82ec1.jpg><p class=align-left>How much money did Ice Cube make from NWA? Ice Cube left the NWA in 1989 and decided to go solo. He left the group because of financial reasons and other royalty disputes.

For his contributions, he only <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">received $32,000</a>.</p><p class=align-left>The amount was small considering, in the previous year, the NWA had grossed $650,000 of which the manager took home $130,000.
