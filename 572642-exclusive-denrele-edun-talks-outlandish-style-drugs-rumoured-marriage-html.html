From his choice of outfit to his hairdo and his shoes, he stands out anywhere he goes to.&nbsp;</strong><strong>The ex-Soundcity VJ and now Channel O VJ spoke with Legit.ng at a beauty pageant recently about his weird fashion sense, drugs and alcohol. He also clears the air on his rumoured wedding.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/1120/vllkyt3nb7dsveqgf.jpeg><p><strong>Your dress sense is always weird; for example, you have on red braids. What inspires your choices?</strong></p><p><i>You know I am wearing this Igbo native attire, isi-agu, and of course when (the Igbos) wear it they always have this red cap on their head. In my own case, my head is small which is weird so I just decided to do the red hair to complement the attire. Actually it was not because of the outfit; I have always and will authentically love red. It’s my favorite colour so I just said to myself I have done red hair but in very short forms so I wanted it in a very long form only for me to realize that the hair extension in a packet is very small. I had to buy like 20 packets of it to make this hair. I did this hair for two straight days, I am not kidding I did not sleep and it’s just one person who did it that’s why.</i></p><p><strong>Two days?</strong></p><p><i>Two days. Its might look not full but the wahala is much. My neck is just tilting to one side.</i></p><p><strong>READ ALSO:</strong>&nbsp;HILARIOUS! Watch As Denrele Edun Falls Off A Stage (VIDEO)</p><p><strong>How long is you natural hair?</strong></p><p><i>My natural hair is quite long. You know my natural hair has never been relaxed it’s like 100 and 10 (per cent) virgin. It looks curly, its fine sha. The only problem is I took the hair for granted. I put so much dye, I use different colours of dye on it. With natural hair, if you don’t steam it every time it begins to cut. You wake up in the morning, your hair is gone. So I just said let me start packing this hair style. I rocked my natural for a week before I did this red hair. And I am already getting tired of this red hair.</i></p><p><strong>For how long do you intend to carry this?</strong></p><p><i>I am one of those people that are guilty of carrying hair for long. When I do my hair I carry it for long because there is actually no time to sit down to make another one. But this particular one I am still going to lose to an extent to make it look very full.</i></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt7p6lr4k0rm4.jpeg><p><strong>How high are your shoes?</strong></p><p><i>Nine-and-half, roughly 10 inches high.</i></p><p><strong>You are so weird...</strong></p><p><i>Am I? I am just like all those regular people who like what they do. There are people that are weirder than me. This is natural; I don’t drink, I don’t smoke. Craziness is natural.</i></p><p><strong>Really?</strong></p><p><i>I have never smoked in my life. Drinking, I can hold a glass of champagne for four hours and just be talking and laughing and act as if I want to drink it. Before you know it, I would just look for where to throw it away, but I have never smoked in my life.</i></p><p>[article_adwert]</p><p><strong>READ ALSO:</strong>&nbsp;Another ‘Caityln Jenner’ In Nigeria? (SEE PHOTOS)</p><p><strong>Just imagine you smoked, how would you have behaved?</strong></p><p><i>Well, you see that drinking and smoking part, I would have been really something else. A lot of artists and entertainers not only in Nigeria but around the world take a lot of stimulants before they get on stage, to enhance and boost their stage performances, but I don’t because I am naturally a hyper-energetic person. And I thought about it, if I take this thing “e go melo me o”. If I took all the hard drugs I would just be very slow and be looking at everybody. Maybe I think that is what that sort of thing will do to someone like me.</i></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkytee7kbisobpm.jpeg><p><strong>I also learnt that you have a sister that acts like a man?</strong></p><p><i>There are plenty misconceptions anyway. I have two younger sisters. My immediate younger sister has a lot of tattoos. I don’t have tattoos or piercing but this one has plenty of tattoos. You know we are all together, we are family. Once in a while I can take her shirt, she can take my jeans and because we wear a lot of each other's clothes everybody just assumes she is trying to be a man. My other one is normal. You know Nigerians, they will forever talk. Leave them to talk their talk. But my sister Ronke is Ronke, Jumoke is Jumoke, Denrele is Denrele.</i></p><p><strong>There was wedding rumours in the air some time ago, are you still going ahead with it?</strong></p><p><i>I wouldn’t necessarily say wedding rumors because I was talking someone and it was a conversation on wedding and I was said for my wedding, my wife’s dress will be short, we will not spend plenty money on elaborate material and my own suit will be long and very dramatic. I was just saying I wouldn’t want the media to know who I am getting married to so that they won’t just wahala the girl for me. We will use veil to cover her face till the wedding is over, anyone that wants to see her will pay money. It was just one of those talks. And everybody started talking Denrele is getting married. People in my life started saying, 'you are getting married and you didn’t tell me.' I still deal with the wedding story every day. I am definitely going to get married. I wanted to even marry this year. At a point the media blew it out of proportion and I was just hoping the girl I was going to marry would not wake up one morning and say ‘’wait o na me wan marry this guy way dey wear high heel carry hair for head?” She go think am twice. I just hope she is not thinking about it.</i></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/720/vllkyt3bie6bua35f.jpeg><p><strong>How soon are we hearing the wedding bells?</strong></p><p><i>Little by little, we will just be taking it easy. Let’s see how it goes.</i></p><p><strong>Are you sure with marriage you won’t cool down?</strong></p><p><i>Ah! If I cool down where will the money come from? We will not be able to eat again.</i></p><p><strong>What was your attraction to her?</strong></p><p><i>A lot, I like people who can make a dialogue when I am in the room with them not people who will nod their head when you talk, whatever you say is what they will take.</i></p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkgnh%2BlW1pZp2omLm2v8ivnGaclaO%2FprjEZpydrZ5iwaK4yqxkqK2koa6vsMisn2arpK65pnnDq6ygq12nwq671KucnWWdlr%2BztcCgnGegpKK5</p></div><div id=links><a href=./gjin-lipa-html.html>&#171;&nbsp;Gjin Lipa - Age, Family, Bio</a>
