One almost expects pettiness when it comes to the dissolution of a relationship: whether it's intentionally changing your Netflix account information or making passive-aggressive social media posts about you. The same can happen with best friends, just ask <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Mudasir about this classic meme</a>.</p><p>But <a href=#>what about the workplace</a>?</p><p>While one would accept this kind of emotionally-charged trifling behavior, in the workplace we'd think it would be less common. But that isn't the case at all.</p><p>Like this Auto Shop that was dealing with a former employee who was adamant about receiving his last paycheck.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Warner Bros.</span></figure><p>A-OK Walker Luxury Autoworks has worked on Ford Mustang convertibles for Trouble With the Curve and has been working on high-end and rare cars for years. However most recently they've been accused of paying a former employee with a wheelbarrow of pennies, 91,500 of them to be exact.</p><p>The New York Times reported that A OK gave Andres Flaten his final paycheck in thousands of coins smeared in what is presumably transmission fluid. He was a manager at the autobody shop and asked for the $915 that the business owed him. On a Mid-March day he received a wheelbarrow packed with greasy pennies.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>His girlfriend, Olivia Oxley posted a clip of the mound of pennies on Instagram. In one of the videos she dips her hand into the pile of coins and her fingers are covered in a shiny substance. She posted about the ill-treatment Andres reportedly endured as an employee of the automotive shop.</p><p>She wrote:</p><p>"My boyfriend's last paycheck delivered at the end of the driveway in pennies....at 8pm on a Friday. His last day was in November."</p><p>She continued: "First things first when he quit he gave a written resignation letter complete with a two weeks notice. After Miles Walker of AOK Walker auto works continued to be the a**hole he is and make a normal workday hell, making unnecessary comments about my boyfriend's daughter and just be an all-around d**k, that 2 weeks turned into 5 days."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Olivia Oxley (@ox_isms)</a></p></figure><p>"My boyfriend respectfully delivered his uniforms washed and in a box comeplete with another letter as to why he was leaving early. Fast forward 3 months and he was refusing to send out the last paycheck claiming damages to the shop. Once the word “lawyer” was introduced, this is what he did."</p><p>"1. We can’t even get all the pennies up because they’re covered in some type of oil.<br>2. Who the hell knows how were going to get them out of the driveway, up into the car, out of the car again, and into a bank or coin star. And that’s if we can even do that because they’re covered in oil."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>"I’m not sure what’s worse...the fact that this man is so miserable he can’t accept an employee leaving because he’s the biggest a**hole I’ve seriously ever met, or the fact that he went through THAT much effort to get $915 worth of HEAVYYY pennies just to say ‘f**k you’. I mean....couldn’t he have just pissed on the check or something?....."</p><p>"MILES WALKER @ AOK WALKER AUTOWORKS in peachtree city.<br>PLEASE SHARE WITH ANYONE. Bring him down. No one like that deserves to have successful business."</p><p>Tons of people posted their sympathies in response to Olivia's Instagram upload.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>For the most part, folks seemed sympathetic. Yelp reviewers flocked to the Auto Body's shop page in order to bomb it with negative comments and 1-star reviews. It currently sits at a 1.5 out of 5, however, it seems that Yelp has posted an "unusual activity" alert in order to notify folks that A OK has been the subject of some recent ire that doesn't directly reflect the quality of service the business may or may not provide prospective clients.</p><p>It seems like A OK may have gotten their inspiration in paying Andreas with pennies in a wheelbarrow from this one individual who got their car towed and was angry about having to pay the fine in order to get their automobile back.</p><p>So they decided to pay them using the same method, and uploaded the whole thing on YouTube.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dHMjyi gzSWnW"></figure><p>Here's the thing: as inconvenient as it is, businesses and individuals cannot reject viable forms of legal tender, and that includes paying someone in pennies. However, there is a coin shortage due to COVID, so they may want to bring that up if they wanted to dispute the form of payment they received legally.</p><p>This isn't the first time an employer acted petty to their workers, however and there are Redditors with some harrowing tales of dealing with some less-than-ideal bosses.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Refusing a hug.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: YouTube</span></figure><p>"Supervisor asked me for a hug, I declined, she said she refused to have anyone unhappy on shift and told me I should go home." - <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Underhaul</a>.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Quoting a reality TV show when firing an employee.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: CBS</span></figure><p>"My bosses gave everyone a copy of the schedule that had all the names of the workers.
