Fans want to see him pay.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>In this day and age, it’s hard to truly trust anyone. For celebrities, it can be even harder to trust new people — in business or personal relationships. After all, some people have hidden agendas and have no qualms about using celebs to ultimately get what they want. And <a href=#>Kevin Hart </a>is currently feeling the burn.</p><p>In case you missed it, the comedian’s personal shopper — <a href=#>Dylan Syer</a> — is reportedly in hot water with the star and the authorities. He has been accused of defrauding the Night School actor. And things have gone from bad to worse as Syer has been formally charged in New York City.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What exactly is Dylan being charged with?</h2><p>During Dylan's tenure with the star, he was responsible for pulling pieces and completing tasks to Kevin's request. But after working with the star over the years, he decided to get a piece of Kevin's lavish lifestyle.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>, Dylan "allegedly stole more than $1 million from the actor by making unauthorized purchases with Kevin's credit cards."</p><p>"Dylan was arraigned in Queens Supreme Court on Wednesday, Feb.10, 2021, facing grand larceny and other charges," the Queens District Attorney Melinda Katz announced.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Page Six</a> reports that Dylan was hired by Hart in 2015 and "started small with legitimate, authorized purchases for his client." Soon after, he used Kevin's credit cards to funnel cash into his personal accounts and purchased various items. He then had them sent to his home and business via FedEx.</p><p>And by the looks of it, Dylan was a pretty busy man. The publication reports that he was "charged on a 10-count indictment with grand larceny in the first and second degree, criminal possession of stolen property in the first and second degree, identity theft in the first degree, and scheme to defraud in the first degree."</p><p>Fans of the star were naturally shocked by the news, while some people couldn't resist making a joke out of the situation.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Kevin Hart's personal shopper when Kevin asks him to go to the grocery store for grapes. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/WtpHokPbdr</a></p>— Sad Houston Sportsman (@RedIsNotAFlavor) <a href=#>February 11, 2021</a> <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Twitter</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Kevin Hart's personal shopper used his credit card to make over $1 million in unauthorized purchases.

"Among these art and collectible purchases was a Sam Friedman painting, at least 16 Bearbrick collectible dolls, five KAWS collectible dolls, and two Louis Vuitton Keepall Bandouliere bags."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>While Kevin has not yet commented on the situation, you can expect the star to address things pretty soon. Kevin is known to always address any issues that he is attached to and he may even include the situation in his future stand-up acts.&nbsp;</p><p>In the past, the comedian has shared his perspective on his divorce, <a href=#>cheating on his wife</a>, Eniko Hart, and other family issues in his comedy specials.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">This is not the first time Kevin dealt with someone allegedly betraying his trust.</h2><p>Unfortunately, this is not Kevin's first rodeo of someone close to the star betraying his trust.

Prosecutors revealed that he allegedly tried to sell the recording to numerous celebrity news websites.&nbsp;</p><p>And while the extortion charges against J.T were later dropped in October 2019, per the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Philadelphia Inquirer</a>, the relationship between the two was permanently severed.&nbsp;</p><p>There is no telling what the outcome of Dylan's case will be, but he has a fight ahead of him.
